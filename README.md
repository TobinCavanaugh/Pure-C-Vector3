# Pure-C-Vector3

A simple vector3 math library for C

This math should work, feel free to send me a message if you get edgecases or weird bugs.

This is not heavily tested and not production ready code!!

I did this project because I want to build out a library of... well libraries, for future use in projects, and I figured a 3D Vectors would be helpful. Of course before finishing this project I began making a 2D engine in C. Yes, I do understand the irony here.

Installing it should be easy, just pop the .h and .c files into your project and add them to CMAKE if you must.

I used CLion for this project and did my best to not touch any external or weird libraries, so this should be crossplatform. I don't see any reason it wouldn't be.
